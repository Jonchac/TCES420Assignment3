# TCES420Assignment3
Project I worked on during my class in TCES 420. Multiple Queues to simulate a 16 thread scheduler.
TCES 420, Fall 2016 -- Project #3



The objective of this project is to gain experience constructing, running,
and debugging parallel, multi-threaded programs using pthreads as well
as gain some experience with simple, centralized schedulers. You will
need to implement this project as a user space application in the Clanguage.
For this project, you are to implement a simple centralized scheduler for a
16-core SMP machine in which a subset of thread acts as local worker
threads for executing different phases of each job, similar to a thread-pool
model.
A job in the case of this project is simply a sequence of two types of
phases: CPU phases and I/O phases. You will define a data structure (or
data structures) to keep track of the jobs as they are injected into the
system. Each phase will have a time associated with it. The time indicates
how long the phase lasts and how long the corresponding threads must
“execute” it. Note that you will not have to execute anything during these
phases; rather the time simply indicates how long each thread should
delay before proceeding to the next phase.
For example, the below may be insufficient depending on your
implementation, but one way may be to use a structure named job
capable of tracking phases, durations, and progress to completion that
you will use to track the state of each job in the system:
struct job {
int job_id;
int nr_phases;
 int current_phase;
// Phase types: 1 = CPU phase; 2 = IO phase
int phasetype_and_duration[NR_PHASES][NR_PHASES];
int is_completed = 0;
};
You will need to instantiate multiple instances of jobs with different phase
types and durations including different combinations of CPU and IO
phases (IOW, you don’t have to use the above phase definitions; you may
choose your own mechanisms and/or definitions). Each phase must have 
a time associated with it, such that the local CPU and I/O schedulers know
how long each phase runs.
Operational Details
Figure 1 below provides a pictorial view of how your threaded job
executions sequence should work.
You will implement three queues to handle scheduling job to either run on
CPUs or perform I/O:
1) A Read/Run queue for jobs ready to run a CPU-bound phase,
2) An I/O Wait queue for jobs waiting to start an I/O phase
3) A Finished queue for jobs that have completed all job phases.
Jobs that are not running should be placed in one of the three queues
depending on their state If a given job is runnable, meaning the job was
just started OR the next part of the job is CPU-bound, the job will be put
into the run queue. If a job is waiting on I/O, it should put into the I/O wait
queue, so that an I/O thread can run it.
Out of the 16 threads in the system, you must have three distinct types of
threads running as follows:
• Eight CPU threads – These are threads who have the exclusive role of
“running” the CPU-bound phases of jobs as defined in the job
profile. These threads must handle adding jobs to the run queue
when they are runnable (At the completion of a CPU-phase, where
the next phase is runnable). They must also handle adding jobs to
the I/O queue when a CPU-phase completes and the next phase is
I/O-bound. Finally, they must handle the case when a job completes
and should be put on the finished queue. CPU threads that are not
currently running a job should continually check the Run queue for
newly injected and/or scheduled jobs. Moreover, before transitioning
jobs back onto one of the three queues for the next phase (or
completion), the CPU threads should update the job data structure
with the completed phase.
• Four I/O handling threads – these are the I/O handling threads. These
threads will be responsible for checking on the state of the I/O Wait
queue for jobs that are waiting for I/O phases to be completed.
When jobs are added to the I/O Wait queue, they will take them off
the queue and “execute” the I/O phase by waiting for the
appropriate phase time before either putting them back onto the
Run, IO Waiting, or Finished queues depending on the next phase of
the job. Just like the CPU threads, the I/O handling threads should
also update the job data structure when a phase completes and
putting the job onto the appropriate queue for the next phase.
• Four Job submission threads- These threads are solely responsible for
creating jobs at a given frequency and submitting them to the ready
queue. This should follow a similar approach to the process of
creating new processes and threads we discussed in class. Each job
submission thread should have a way to keep track of the processes
each created so that it can monitor the Finished queue for
completed jobs it created and free the memory associated with the
job. The minimum job creation and injection rate for these threads
should be every 2-3 seconds. In other words, each of the four job
submission threads should inject new jobs into the system at least
every 2-3 seconds. When they are not submitting jobs, they should 
be checking the Finished queue for completed jobs.
Atomicity requirement – Each phase of each job should be executed
atomically and only once. In other words, because there are eight CPU
threads and four I/O handling threads, you could have multiple threads
attempting to en-queue or de-queue jobs onto the queues concurrently.
Consequently, you must ensure consistency and atomicity of share data
structures. For example, adding or removing elements from each queue
may require locks, semaphores, or other constructs as we’ve discussed
for mutual exclusion.
Output requirements - The threads in your application should print out a
message when 1) jobs are started, 2) when jobs transition between
queues, 3) when executing on CPU threads and I/O threads, 4) when
completed (transitioned to the Finished queue), and 5) when each jobs is
officially complete (taken off the Finished queue and freed by the creating
thread). Please either redirect the output from the program to a file (if
you’re just using stdout) or write to a file.
Project Submission Details:
Please submit the following via the Canvas site for the class by the dead
line :
• C-based, pthread source code for your program.
• Makefile to build your project
• Copy of the output from your program showing job creations, transitions,
completions, etc.
Single page written summary of the challenges you encountered doing this
project. For this write-up please describe how you approached handling
mutual exclusion amongst the threads.
